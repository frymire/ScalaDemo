# ScalaDemo
Just some idioms to remind me how to use Scala.

Import into Eclipse as an Existing Maven Project, then

1) Project Properties -> Configure -> Add Scala Nature<br>
2) Right-click src/target/scala, then Build Path -> Use as Source Folder.<br>

(After much fuss with m2e and scala-maven-plugin, there doesn't
seem to be a good way to automate these steps.)
